## Schizohaptic VR

It is a research application in virtual reality therapies for the treatment and study of schizophrenia. The application has been developed in conjunction with the Universidad del Valle and the Hospital Departamental Psiquiátrico Universitario del Valle (HDPUV). Developed by the Multimedia and Computer Vision research group (MVC) with the support of Dr Juan Carlos Rivas Nieto.

### Haptic Technology

Haptic technology refers to the set of technological interfaces that interact with humans through the sense of touch. It is an emerging technology since the 90s that is promisingly evolving in some fields of application. One type of haptic technology used in this project is the virtual simulation of touch using miniature motors (actuators) that are distributed in a glove to simulate touch within a virtual environment.

### Virtual Reality Therapy in Schizophrenia

Studies have shown that VR is a useful tool to assess and treat evaluated patients with schizophrenia through positive and negative signs (Brito, H., & Vicente, B. (2018). Virtual reality and its applications in mental disorders: a review)

### Virtual Reality Therapy with Haptic Technology in Schizophrenia

This is the main focus of this application-study, since it is a field in virtual reality therapy that has not been fully explored.
